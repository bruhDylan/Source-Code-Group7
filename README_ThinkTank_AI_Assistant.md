# Think Tank AI Assistant 

An AI-powered chatbot that leverages **Azure Cognitive Search** and **Azure OpenAI GPT-4** to assist users by answering questions based on company knowledge sources.

 Currently deployed for demonstration on the **Lovable website**.  
 Backend + API implemented using **FastAPI**.  
 Frontend built in **React**.

---

##  Project Overview

**Goal:** To build an intelligent chatbot capable of answering user queries by retrieving relevant documents and generating conversational responses.

**Key Features:**
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (**RAG**) pipeline using Azure Cognitive Search.
- Natural language answers generated by **GPT-4**.
- Simple web-based chat interface built in React.
- Modular backend API (FastAPI) ‚Äî ready for containerized deployment.

##  Build & Deployment

### Current Deployment Status

Due to time constraints, the model was not fully deployed on Azure.  
The current version of the chatbot is deployed on the **Lovable website** for demonstration purposes.

All API endpoints and backend logic are stored in GitHub, with sensitive credentials (API keys, endpoints) managed through environment variables in a `.env` file.

### Data Access

The chatbot retrieves data from an **Azure Cognitive Search index** (RAG pipeline).  
All responses are generated based on documents retrieved from this RAG index.  
No external APIs or additional databases were used.

### CI/CD Pipeline

While a full Azure DevOps Pipeline was not implemented, this is the intended structure based on our architecture:

```yaml
# Example Azure Pipeline
stages:
  - build_frontend: npm install && npm run build
  - deploy_backend: docker push thinktank-api:v1.0
  - run_tests: pytest /backend/tests
```

**Current Implementation:**
- The React frontend is built locally and deployed on the Lovable website.
- The backend is tested and run locally via FastAPI.
- The backend API code is container-ready (Dockerfile prepared), though full Azure deployment is pending.

### Environment Variables

Environment variables are stored securely in GitHub using a `.env` file (not committed to the repository).

| Variable                | Production Value                                  | Purpose                            |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT` | `https://thinktank-search.search.windows.net`     | Azure Cognitive Search endpoint    |
| `AZURE_SEARCH_API_KEY`  | `[Stored in .env / Key Vault]`                    | Cognitive Search API authentication |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` | `https://gpt.openai.azure.com` (planned)          | GPT-4 model API endpoint           |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`  | `[Stored in .env / Key Vault]`                    | GPT-4 model API authentication     |

**Note:** `ES_HOST` and `IVANTI_KEY` were part of the initial plan but were not required in the final RAG-based implementation.

##  System Architecture

### Architecture Diagram

### Flow Summary

1. User types a question in the React Chatbot UI.
2. The frontend sends the question via REST API to the FastAPI backend.
3. The backend first queries the Azure Cognitive Search index (RAG pipeline).
4. Retrieved documents are sent along with the question to Azure OpenAI GPT-4 API.
5. GPT-4 generates a response grounded in the retrieved content.
6. The response is returned to the user via the React Chat UI.

##  Development Approach

We followed an **Agile iterative approach**, with flexible task ownership and continuous integration of new improvements.  
The team worked collaboratively across different work streams, continuously refining the solution based on testing and evolving requirements.

### Why Agile?

- Our project timeline was short, requiring rapid prototyping.
- The solution evolved as we learned more about the RAG pipeline and deployment constraints.
- Team members worked in parallel on different components (Data, Frontend, Backend, Architecture).

### In Practice:

- We continuously tested the chatbot and refined it based on results.
- We pivoted when deployment constraints changed (Azure ‚Üí Lovable site for demo).
- We prioritized getting an MVP chatbot working first and then iterating to improve quality.

---

##  Summary

- The system is deployed on **Lovable** for demonstration purposes.  
- Backend and API are fully implemented and version-controlled in **GitHub**.  
- Data flow relies on the **RAG pipeline** with Cognitive Search and GPT-4 via API.  
- CI/CD is prepared but full automated deployment is still a future step.
